I decided that I wanted to become a computer scientist because I told myself that this was the career of the future. Whenever I think about what I will be doing, I always like to imagine myself developing something new. It would be a dream of course to have the opportunity to work with leading companies such as Amazon, Facebook, or even Google. I do not know what that something “new” might look like or even what field of computer science that it may fall under. What I do know is that software engineering will be key in my pursuit of such a goal. 

I think that it is really exciting that I am beginning to learn the tools that I need to unlock my path to the future. I look forward to advancing my individual coding skills by adding new languages to my tool belt and continuing to practice the thought process of a computer scientist. While every subject has its subtleties and nuances, I believe that studying computer science requires a very distinct approach. On top of improving my individual skill, it is exciting to learn to work in a group and see what it is like to be a software engineer in the professional world. 

Though I may not end up strictly being a software engineer in the future, I would like to see how software engineering may connect to other disciplines in computer science that have sparked my interest. Cyber security and network architecture have also caught my eye and I hope to explore the basics of these fields further as I continue my education.
