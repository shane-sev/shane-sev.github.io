Semantic UI is the shortcut that allowed us to transform our websites from boys into men. As a new user to HTML and CSS, the bare bones websites that we first created were not all that attractive. In order to create something that people would take the time to look at, it must pass the eye test. Semantic UI is a powerful tool that allows us to do so quickly. 

In my experience, I view Semantic UI as a sort of library. It is true that this means you will need to take the time to learn and practice the syntax of Semantic UI in order to unlock its full capabilities, but the intuitive nature of Semantic UI (thanks to its use of natural language) makes the learning process much easier. In a little over a week’s worth of time spent learning Semantic UI, I was already able to essentially replicate the frequented home page of the University of Hawai’i at Manoa. This is a testament to the ease at which you can learn to use Semantic UI.

The reason that Semantic UI serves as a shortcut to transform our websites into more professional products is because it simplifies the formatting process. I believe that styling our websites is the most difficult part of working with HTML and CSS. Semantic UI provides us with easy ways to rearrange our content. For example, the grid element allows us to divide our website into rows and columns. Another helpful element is the menu which allows us to easily create what the name implies. The only drawback of Semantic UI is that you occasionally need to override the styles provided by the Semantic UI code. Overall however I highly recommend trying out Semantic UI or similar frameworks to take your websites to the next level.
